# AVR_INTERRUPT
nterrupt Handling for AVR Microcontrollers
Interrupts are an essential feature in microcontrollers, including AVR-based ones, that allow the processor to respond to external events and prioritize certain tasks over others. The AVR microcontrollers come with various hardware and software interrupt sources, enabling efficient and timely handling of events.

Overview
The Interrupt Handling library for AVR Microcontrollers provides a user-friendly interface to configure and manage interrupts efficiently. It simplifies the process of setting up interrupt handlers and enables seamless integration of interrupt-driven functionalities into your AVR projects.

Key Features
Interrupt Configuration: Easily set up and enable different types of interrupts, such as external interrupts, timer interrupts, and ADC interrupts.

Interrupt Service Routine (ISR): Define and implement interrupt service routines to handle specific events when the corresponding interrupt occurs.

Interrupt Prioritization: Configure the interrupt priorities to ensure that critical tasks are handled promptly.

Interrupt Safety: The library takes care of saving and restoring the CPU context during interrupt handling, ensuring data integrity.

Interrupt Control: Enable or disable interrupts globally or individually as needed.

Sample Applications: Well-documented sample applications demonstrate various use cases and serve as a quick reference for beginners.

Installation
To incorporate the Interrupt Handling library into your AVR project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the source code.
Copy the relevant driver files (interrupt.c and interrupt.h) into your project directory.
Include the interrupt.h header file in your application code.
Usage
Using the Interrupt Handling library involves the following steps:

Initialize Interrupts: Call the initialization function to configure the global interrupt settings.

Enable Specific Interrupts: Set up individual interrupt sources (e.g., external interrupts, timer interrupts) and enable their corresponding interrupts.

Define and Implement ISRs: Create and implement interrupt service routines for each enabled interrupt source.

Enable Global Interrupts: Enable global interrupts to allow the processor to respond to the configured interrupts.
